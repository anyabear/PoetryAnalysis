(0.0) Dearest Father, forgive me for I have seen. 

(1.0) Behind the wooden fence, a field lit

(-1.0) with summer, a man pressing a shank

(-0.5) to another man's throat. Steel turning to light

(0.5) on sweat-slick neck. Forgive me

(0.0) for not calling Your name. For thinking:

(0.5) this must be how every prayer

(0.5) begins-the word Please cleaving

(0.0) the wind into fragments, into what

(0.0) a boy hears in his need to know

(-1.0) how pain blesses the body back

(-0.5) to its sinner. The hour suddenly

(1.0) stilled. The man genuflected, his lips

(-0.5) pressed to black boot as the words spilled

(0.0) from his mouth like rosaries

(-0.5) shattering from too much

(0.5) Father. Am I wrong to love

(1.0) those eyes, to see something so clear

(0.5) and blue-beg to remain

(1.0) clear and blue? Did my cheek twitch

(-1.0) when that darkness bloomed from his crotch

(0.0) and trickled into ochre dirt? Father,

(-0.5) how quickly the blade becomes

(0.0) You. But let me begin again: There's a boy

(-0.5) kneeling in a house with every door kicked open

(-0.5) to summer. There's a question corroding

(-1.0) his tongue. There's a knife touching

(0.0) Your name lodged inside the throat.

(0.0) Dearest Father, what becomes of the boy

(1.0) no longer a boy? Please-

(1.0) what becomes of the shepherd

(-1.0) when the sheep are cannibals?
